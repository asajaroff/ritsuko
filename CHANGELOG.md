  - Updated journalctl command to include `--no-follow` flag

- **Clusters command output** (`src/commands.py`)
  - Added link to VMS Global Uptime dashboard in header
  - Removed obsolete clusters (c000, c004, c005, c010)

- **Command routing** (`src/commands.py`)
  - Reordered match cases: help, ai, mcp, node, clusters, status, version
  - Removed `ping` and `echo` command handlers

- **Version command** (`src/commands.py`)
  - Updated default version string to include more context

### Removed

- **Removed `src/run.sh` script**
  - Shell script is no longer needed for local development

### Technical Improvements

- **Production readiness**: Health checks enable proper Kubernetes lifecycle management
- **Reliability**: Kubernetes probes can detect and restart unhealthy pods
- **Monitoring**: Dedicated health endpoints separate from application logic
- **Developer experience**: Enhanced command outputs with better structure and more useful information

- **Command parsing system** (`src/commands.py`)
  - New `parse_command()` function that intelligently parses commands based on message type:
    - Stream messages: extracts second word (first word after bot mention)
    - Private messages: extracts first word directly
  - New `execute_command()` function with match/case (Python 3.10+) switch statement for command routing
  - Built-in commands:
    - `help` - Display available commands
    - `ping` - Health check / bot responsiveness test
    - `status` - Show bot operational status
    - `echo <text>` - Echo back provided text
    - `version` - Display bot version information
  - Extensible command handler architecture for easy addition of new commands
  - Unknown command handling with helpful error messages

- **Command parsing tests** in `src/test_bot.py`
  - Tests for command parsing from stream messages
  - Tests for command parsing from private messages
  - Tests for all command handlers (help, ping, status, echo, version)
  - Tests for edge cases (empty messages, unknown commands, missing arguments)
  - Integration tests for command execution within message handling flow
  - Total of 20 passing tests covering all functionality

- **Comprehensive error handling throughout the bot**
  - Environment variable validation at startup (checks for `ZULIP_EMAIL`, `ZULIP_API_KEY`, `ZULIP_SITE`)
  - Try-except block around Zulip client initialization with proper error logging
  - New `send_message()` helper function that wraps all message sending with error handling
  - Exception handling in `handle_message()` for `KeyError` and general exceptions
  - Graceful shutdown handling for `KeyboardInterrupt` in main message loop
  - Proper exit codes for different failure scenarios

- **Unit test suite** (`src/test_bot.py`)
  - Tests for `send_message()` function:
    - Successful message sending
    - Failed message sending (Zulip API errors)
    - Exception handling (network errors, etc.)
  - Tests for `handle_message()` function:
    - Bot ignoring its own messages
    - Authorized user messages in private chats
    - Authorized user messages in streams
    - Unauthorized user messages in private chats
    - Unauthorized user messages in streams
    - Handling of messages with missing required fields
  - All tests use proper mocking to avoid requiring actual Zulip connections

- **Testing dependencies**
  - Added `pytest==8.3.4` to requirements.txt
  - Added `pytest-cov==6.0.0` to requirements.txt for coverage reporting

- **Makefile targets for testing**
  - `make test`: Runs the full test suite with verbose output
  - `make test-coverage`: Runs tests with coverage report showing line-by-line coverage

### Changed

- **Bot message handling** (`src/bot.py`)
  - Integrated command parsing system via `execute_command()` import
  - Bot now routes all authorized user messages through the command parser
  - Responses are now generated by command handlers instead of simple echo
  - Message handling tests updated to validate command execution flow

- Refactored all `client.send_message()` calls to use the new `send_message()` helper function
- Added docstrings to `send_message()` and `handle_message()` functions
- Enhanced logging messages with better error context
- Bot now logs "Starting Zulip bot..." message on startup for better visibility

### Removed

- Removed commented-out code (lines 40-47) that was no longer needed
  - Removed unused `original_content` variable
  - Removed unused `original_sender` variable
  - Removed placeholder code for `@followup` functionality

### Technical Improvements

- **Robustness**: Bot will now fail fast with clear error messages if misconfigured
- **Observability**: All errors are properly logged with context for easier debugging
- **Maintainability**: Centralized error handling makes future changes easier
- **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability and makes refactoring safer
- **Production-ready**: Proper signal handling allows clean shutdowns in containerized environments

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- Authorization logic (authorized vs unauthorized users)
- Message type handling (private vs stream messages)
- Error scenarios (missing fields, API failures, network errors)
- Bot self-message filtering
- Message response content verification
